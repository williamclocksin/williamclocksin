William Clocksin is a recently 
retired Professor of Computer Science who has been
programming since 1971.
Developer of Calliope (1992-1999), a music notation editor for performance editions of early music.
Calliope was 56,000 lines of Objective-C and ran on NextStep computers. 
Now translating Calliope into JavaFX and using modern technology e.g. SMuFL, MusicXML, to run on Mac OS. 
Interested in using MNX as an interchange format. 

Other projects include a program for OCR of historical Syriac manuscripts and printed books. 
This has been used to transliterate about 20% of the world's corpus of Syriac into
a form that can be used by scholars. It handles the three main scripts of Syriac,
and has also been used to transliterate other connected script
languages such as Arabic, Urdu, and English cursive handwriting. 

I have also written the software for the next generation of automatic number plate recognition
for UK car number plates. 

A recent project is an animated simulation of a community of agents
to investigate personhood and relationality issues in computational sociology.

These projects will eventually find their way onto GitHub when
I figure out how to do it.
